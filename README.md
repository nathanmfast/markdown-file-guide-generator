# Markdown File Guide Generator

## TODO
- improve naming
  - don't mention "readme" except in describing possible uses
  - do mention markdown
- determing how to properly package it for re-use
  - people probably just want the executable so they can use it however works for them in their workflow
- handle descriptions in some way
  - one idea would be to (optionally) pass in the previous markdown with descriptions and it would parse the old one and pair up matching filepaths to re-apply your previous descriptions. it could then report back any filepath/descriptions it was unable to find a match for, and the user would be able to manually apply those where they need to go

## Example Usage

>`import { generate } from './readme-generator'`  
>` `  
>`const markdown = generate('C:\\Projects\\my-project', ['.git', 'dist', 'node_modules'])`  
>`console.log(markdown)`  

## Example Output

This is "File Guide" generated by this tool for the code used to create it.

| File/Folder            | Description |

## Want to tweak it?

Feel free to modify this to suit your needs. It may help to have some of my notes I used to arrive at this design, which I've included below.

### Table Design

The table below lays out a specific example and helps to visualize the logic used to arrange the table and the folder structure in the first column.

| Depth |  1    |  2    |  3    | Name                      |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------------------------|
| 0     |       |       |       | src/                      |
| 1     |  ├─   |       |       | ├─ utility/               |
| 2     |  │    |  ├─   |       | │  ├─ subfolder/          |
| 3     |  │    |  │    |  ├─   | │  │  ├─ file1.ts         |
| 3     |  │    |  │    |  └─   | │  │  └─ file2.ts         |
| 2     |  │    |  ├─   |       | │  ├─ tools/              |
| 3     |  │    |  │    |  └─   | │  │  └─ parser.ts        |
| 2     |  │    |  ├─   |       | │  ├─ longer-file-name.ts |
| 2     |  │    |  └─   |       | │  └─ processor.ts        |
| 1     |  └─   |       |       | └─ app.ts                 |

### Rules

Each indentation uses 3 characters.  

Spacers carry a line down past nested levels and look like this:  

>│  

After however many spacers are needed for the depth you are at, you either have:

>├─   

or, if it is the last item in the folder:

>└─   

No-break spaces (U+00A0) are used to ensure proper handling of whitespace.
