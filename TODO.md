# TODO

 - Create "--help" command line arg response
 - Note that after the "--" args are all specified, anything else that appears will be treated as the name of a folder you don't want the generator to crawl when it produces its table. 
   - Separate folder names by spaces.
   - If a folder name has a space in it, wrap it in quotes. e.g.:
     - "my folder" node_modules dist .git
